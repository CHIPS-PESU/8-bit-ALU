# 8-bit-ALU

"kernel.cpp" is the main kernel.
"testbench.cpp" is the testbench used to run simulation.
"bit32alu.hpp" is the headerfile.

These will have to be added in their respective files on Vitis HLS

Once the files are added and simulation is run, the file "write.txt" has to be opened to view the simulation results.
